You will be building a simple webpage "To-Do List" which contains all of the tasks that you need to complete on a given day.
​
As a user, I would like to add my daily tasks so I can manage my time and oraganize my randomness.
- Create a form in order to add the task name and the date to the local storage.
​
As a user, I would like to view all of my tasks that I already added so that I can quickly view my To-Do List in order to do all of them.
- Whenever you add a task using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the tasks from it and convert it to an ordered list using DOM.
​
**Stretch Goal:** As a user, I would like to delete any task after being done so that I can handle my daily done tasks.
- When you press on the 'X' button, the task should be deleted from the DOM and the local storage
​
​
#### Do this work on a branch called 'q3-solution'.
